 Love affair in School:

Girl's way:
A girl sitting on the  1st bench turns her back & Sees the boy Sitting on the last bench & says - "Thank God, Stupid Aaya 

Hai!"
Boy's way: 
Before the boy could see his girl entering in the class, all his friends start shouting "Abey Teri Wali Aa Gayi"!   Wife: Tell me those 3 magical words.
Husband: Galti Meri Hai!   Pehle Shirt Utaari
Uske Baad Pant Utaari
Aur Fir Banyan Utaari
